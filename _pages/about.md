I am a third year PhD student in pure mathematics working as part of the [algebra research group](http://www-maths.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Algebra/index.php) at the University of St Andrews.

My current research is on maximal subgroups and generation of simple and almost simple groups, supervised by [Prof Colva Roney-Dougal](http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~colva/) and
[Dr Martyn Quick](http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~martyn/).
