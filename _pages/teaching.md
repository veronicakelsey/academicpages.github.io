## Handouts

### For Parents Home Schooling

A hand out on symmetry - probably best for primary school children. [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/sym.pdf) 

A hand out on mazes, minotaurs and maths - best for older secondary school or college students (or younger students with an adult helper). [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/MMM.pdf) 


### For University Students

These handouts were made after requested by students in my tutorial groups, but some of them might be of help even if you aren't on these specfic courses. 

#### MT2504

Sigma/summation notation revision [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/sigma.pdf) 

Inclusion-Exclusion - examples for n=2 and 3 and the proof of the general case [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/inclusionexclusion.pdf) 

Revision session - covering double counting, bijections, derangements and past exam questions [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/Note 2 Dec 2020.pdf)

Revision session - covering recursive formulas and fibonacci numbers (specifically focusing on guessing the "general term", past exam questions and the staircase method) [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/fib.pdf) 

#### MT2505

Properties that can be inherited for groups and for rings/fields [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/Inheritence.pdf)  

A revision sheet on congruences [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/congruencesrevision.pdf)  

#### MT2501

Basic proof layouts and techniques - originally intended for people studying Linear Maths, but potentially of use to any undergrad student [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/proofsrevision.pdf)

An example of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a 3x3 matrix with one Eval/vec pair left to students for practice. At the end of the handout is an example of how to factor degree 3 polynomimals [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/Evals-Evects.pdf)

A handout orginally made for a student curious about how to recover the ''standard'' formula for a linear transformation when the basis is non standard [Handout](https://veronicakelsey.github.io/files/changeofbasis.pdf)
